### RESTful API Service
Process incoming requests from the devices to save and receive workout
information. The api service handles authentication via Basic Auth. The endpoints are as follows:

```
                     user_workouts GET        /api/v1/users/:user_id/workouts(.:format)                                                api/workouts#index
                                   POST       /api/v1/users/:user_id/workouts(.:format)                                                api/workouts#create
                  new_user_workout GET        /api/v1/users/:user_id/workouts/new(.:format)                                            api/workouts#new

                             users GET        /api/v1/users(.:format)                                                                  api/users#index
                                   POST       /api/v1/users(.:format)                                                                  api/users#create

                         edit_user GET        /api/v1/users/:id/edit(.:format)                                                         api/users#edit
                              user GET        /api/v1/users/:id(.:format)                                                              api/users#show
                                   PATCH      /api/v1/users/:id(.:format)                                                              api/users#update
                                   PUT        /api/v1/users/:id(.:format)                                                              api/users#update
                                   DELETE     /api/v1/users/:id(.:format)                                                              api/users#destroy
```

NOTE: Although multiple endpoints are defined, a user is only
authorized to CRUD certain resouces.

### Front-end User Web App
Allow user to view a list of workouts in the userâ€™s workout history.
Users can also save new workouts and modify existing workout
durations. Users can log into the web interface by going to:

```
/profile
```

### Front-end Admin Web App
Admin users have complete control over user resources. Admins can
access the admin interface by going to

```
/admin
```

## Tests

### rspec
The tests are written in rspec and can be run using:

```
rspec
```

Within the request specs, there are benchmarks to get an idea of how
fast the request can be processed.

```
$ rspec -f d

### curl
There is a curl script that will perform some basic api operations
given a host. It can be run like this:

```
HOST=http://localhost:3000 bin/basic_test
